      "narration": "India is located in South Asia, bordered by several countries including Pakistan, China, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. The country has a diverse geography, with mountains, plateaus, and coastal plains. The Himalayan mountain range in the north is home to some of the highest peaks in the world, including Mount Everest. The Indo-Gangetic Plain, which stretches from the Himalayas to the southern tip of India, is one of the most fertile and densely populated regions in the world. Let's consider an example: the city of Mumbai, located on the western coast of India, is a major economic hub and one of the most populous cities in the world. Its strategic location on the Arabian Sea has made it an important center for trade and commerce.",

The country has a vast and diverse geography, with different regions having distinct climate, culture, and natural resources. India is also the second-most populous country in the world, with a population of over 1.38 billion people. The population density varies greatly across different regions, with some areas being highly urbanized and others being rural. For instance, the state of Bihar in eastern India has a population density of over 1,100 people per square kilometer, making it one of the most densely populated regions in the world. On the other hand, the state of Arunachal Pradesh in northeastern India has a population density of just 17 people per square kilometer, making it one of the most sparsely populated regions in the country.",
